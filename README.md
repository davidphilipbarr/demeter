# Demeter

Another 34 Key Keyboard with no diodes. 

Sadly this one does not use the cradio firmware, as it used a jumpered footprint for the controller.

There is a wired version for promicro type controllers and a bluetooth-first version for nice!nano type controllers.

### Changes from the prototype:

* Pointless breakout pins removed.
* Silks removed/hidden.
* Slight edgecut adjustment.
* Wired version added as seperate board.
